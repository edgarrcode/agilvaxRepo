                <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
                <p>Advances in understanding cancer trough years of research from many laboratories have shed light on why some current cancer treatments may be ineffective. Within any tumor, there are different types of cancer cells, only some of which are targeted by a specific treatment. Although a therapy may be successful in killing some of these cell types, others survive and are the cause of recurrence.</p>
                <p>A critical sub-population of tumor cells are called cancer stem cells or cancer initiating cells. These cells are only a small population of cells found in the tumor, but they are responsible for most of the cancer spread and relapse.  Unfortunately, these cells are resistant to many current treatments.</p>
                <p>Further understanding of the unique properties of cancer stem cells will be crucial for the development therapies that reduce cancer relapse and eliminate the spread of cancer throughout the body. Agilvax has identified unique targets of cancer stem cells and is developing therapies that eradicate these cells.</p>

                <h2>Triple Negative Breast Cancer</h2>
                <p>Despite marked advancement in breast cancer treatment and detection, 20-30% of breast cancer patients relapse, often with cancer found in distal organs. Aggressive forms of breast cancer that lack the markers estrogen, progesterone and HER2 (triple negative breast cancer, TNBC) account for 15-20% of all breast cancers in the US. These cancers disproportionally affect young woman and minorities and have higher rates of relapse and poorer outcomes than other forms of breast cancer.</p>
                <p>TNBC are resistant to targeted therapies use to treat other types of breast cancer.  TNBC contain a high frequency of cancer stems cells. While these cells represent a small fraction of cancer cells found in the tumor, they are responsible for most of the cancer spread and relapse. Therefore, effective treatments for TNBC must also target cancer stem cells.</p>
                <p>Agilvax is developing a novel immunotherapy candidate, AX09, which is designed to be a potential stand-alone therapy or used in combination with conventional and emerging treatments for TNBC. AX09 targets a protein found in a high percentage of breast cancers including TNBC and whose expression is predictive of poor outcomes.  This protein is found on nearly all solid tumor cancer stem cells including breast cancer.  Studies show that immunization with AX09 significantly inhibits cancer spread in animal models of TNBC. </p>
