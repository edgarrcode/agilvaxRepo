<h3>About Agilvax</h3>

<h3>Safe Harbor Statement</h3>
<p>The anticipated presentation will contain “forward-looking statements” for purposes of the safe harbor provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the adequacy of the Company’s capital to fund its ongoing operations, the potential for VLPs to treat or prevent any disease, potential VLP side effect profiles, the Company and its collaborators’ abilities to successfully complete clinical trials, timing and eventual prospects for completion of clinical trials and any approval to market any of the Company’s products and the prospects for the Company’s collaborations. Such statements are based on management’s current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and performance could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, without limitation, the risks and uncertainties associated with: the Company’s financial resources and whether they will be sufficient to meet the Company’s business objectives and operational requirements; results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future clinical trial results, the protection and market exclusivity provided by the Company’s intellectual property; risks related to the therapeutic discovery and the regulatory approval process; and, the impact of competitive products and technological changes. The Company’s forward-looking statements also involve assumptions that, if they prove incorrect, would cause its results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
