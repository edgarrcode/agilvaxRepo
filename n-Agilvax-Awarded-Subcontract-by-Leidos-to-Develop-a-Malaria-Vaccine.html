                    <p class="author">Albuquerque, NM</p>
                    <p class="date">November 17, 2016</p>
<p>Agilvax, Inc., today announced that it has been awarded a subcontract from Leidos valued at approximately $400,000 for the screening and development of a potential epitope-based malaria vaccine candidate.</p>

<p>Agilvax has a proprietary virus-like particle (VLP) platform technology that has been utilized to develop several vaccine and cancer stem cell immunotherapy candidates. Agilvax is excited and proud to work with Leidos on the development of a cost-effective and efficacious vaccine against malaria.  Under this subcontract, Agilvax will conduct and oversee research and development projects initiated by Leidos to support the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Malaria Vaccine Development Program's (MVDP) continued effort to develop a malaria vaccine.</p>

<p>The subcontract is funded under Leidos’ USAID MVDP contract in which Leidos will support vaccine research efforts and evaluations in the preclinical, clinical and field stages of development. Malaria is a major public health problem with nearly half of the world’s population living in impacted areas.  Thus, development of a malaria vaccine with improved efficacy and duration over current vaccines in development is paramount to combat this disease. Leidos seeks to expand on the collaborative relationship with Agilvax where a promising vaccine candidate using Agilvax’s VLP platform was previously developed (Ord et al 2014).</p>
