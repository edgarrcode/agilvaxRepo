<p>Agilvax, Inc. a leader in the discovery and development of vaccines and cancer immunotherapies is pleased to announce the Notice of Allowance by the U.S. Patent and Trademark office on August 26, 2016 of a new patent related to the company’s human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine candidate.</p>
<p>The Notice of Allowance in U.S. Patent Application serial number 13/577,484 entitled, “Immunogenic HPV L2-Containing VLP’s and related compositions, contracts, and therapeutic methods” represents an important milestone in the development Agilvax’s next-generation HPV vaccine (AX03). AX03 is a recombinant bacteriophage VLP that has been engineered to display a peptide derived from the minor capsid protein, L2, of HPV, which is highly conversed across multiple HPV types.  Thus, AX03 holds the potential to be a low-cost broadly protective HPV vaccine alternative to currently licensed vaccines.</p>
<p>HPV infection is a necessary cause of nearly all cases of cervical cancer as well as a significant percentage of other anogenital carcinomas, and a growing percentage of oropharyngeal cancers. In the United States alone, it is estimated that in 2008, there were 79 million HPV infections, with 14 million new infections occurring each year.</p>
<p>AX03 is currently undergoing process development, which aided through a collaboration with the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the Nation Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAD), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p>
<p>Agilvax President and CEO stated that “AX03 represents the validation of the company’s proprietary VLP platform and represents a significant licensing opportunity.  We look forward to advancing AX03 as well as additional vaccines and cancer immunotherapies using our VLP platform technology.”</p>
