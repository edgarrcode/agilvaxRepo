                    <p class="author">Albuquerque, NM</p>
                    <p class="date">February 17, 2015</p>

                    <p>Agilvax, Inc. today announced a collaboration with Switzerland based Humabs BioMed that will contribute to the rapid advancement of Agilvax’s ever expanding vaccine and immunotherapy pipeline.  Humabs BioMed has established itself as an innovator and leader in the development of human monoclonal antibodies. Agilvax is excited to utilize antibodies developed from patient survivors of infectious and chronic diseases.  The use of these therapeutic antibodies, which have been proven to be efficacious both in vitro and in in vivo, represent the ideal antibody source to identify virus-like-particle (VLP) vaccine candidates and immunotherapies using Agilvax’s innovative affinity selection technology. Affinity selection with Humabs’ antibodies will lead to the production of VLPs that induce high-titer, durable, and protective antibody responses that mimic the selecting therapeutic monoclonal antibody.  Utilization of Humabs’ best-in-class antibodies will promote the successful development and commercial launch of vaccines and immunotherapies to combat diseases with unmet medical needs.  Agilvax has a proven track record of progressing products through pre-clinical proof of concept in as short as 4 to six months following the affinity selection process. </p>

                    <p>Agilvax President & CEO, Dr. Federica Pericle stated, “Agilvax is committed to developing and increasing accessibility to targeted vaccines and immunotherapies. The utilization of Humabs’ antibodies in our product development process greatly increases our ability to fulfill this mission.  Using antibodies derived from patient survivors ensures the creation of vaccines and immunotherapies that produce strong and precise immune responses, and ultimately improves health outcomes and patient well being.”</p>

                    <h3>About Agilvax</h3>
                    <p>Agilvax (<a href="http://www.agilvax.com">www.agilvax.com</a>) develops vaccines targeting infectious diseases and immunotherapies to combat cancer utilizing its proprietary virus-like particle (VLP) platform technology. The company has a pipeline and platform that is based on VLPs derived from RNA bacteriophage that have been engineered to incorporate novel peptide epitopes. The platform allows the company to rapidly identify ideal VLP candidates, moving from hypothesis to preclinical proof of concept in months. The Company was founded in 2011 and has headquarters in Albuquerque, NM, USA.</p>

                    <h3>About Humabs BioMed</h3>
                    <p>Humabs BioMed’s (<a href="http://www.humabs.com">www.humabs.com</a>) proprietary platforms are delivering a rich pipeline of high quality and distinct human monoclonal antibodies, particularly tailored to specific diseases. Humabs is working on a large portfolio and already has a diverse pipeline of proprietary human antibodies. Besides its own pre-clinical programs, Humabs is also involved in joint R&D programs with a number of pharmaceutical companies. Humabs’ strategy is to generate and develop potent and fully characterized human monoclonal antibodies to a pre-clinical level before licensing to partners for development and commercialization. </p>
