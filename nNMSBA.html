                    <p class="author">Albuquerque, NM</p>
                    <p class="date">May 12, 2015</p>
<p>Agilvax Inc., a biotechnology company that develops vaccines and immunotherapies to combat infectious diseases and cancer, announced an agreement with Sandia National Laboratories to optimize the long-term stability and efficacy of the Company’s products.  Agilvax is gaining access to Sandia’s scientists and expertise through an award from the New Mexico Small Business Assistance (NMSBA) program.</p>

<p>The work performed with Sandia scientists is vital to ensure that Agilvax’s proprietary vaccines and therapies will be accessible to the global population.  Numerous vaccines lose their effectiveness if they are exposed to extreme heat or freezing conditions; thus, developing innovative technologies to ensure distribution outside of cold-chain requirements is essential to provide access to vaccines and therapies to at risk populations residing in resource poor regions of the world.</p>

<h3>About Agilvax</h3>
<p>Agilvax (<a href="http://www.agilvax.com">www.agilvax.com</a>) develops vaccines targeting infectious diseases and immunotherapies to combat cancer utilizing its proprietary virus-like particle (VLP) platform technology. The company has a pipeline and platform that is based on VLPs derived from RNA bacteriophage that have been engineered to incorporate novel peptide epitopes. The platform allows the company to rapidly identify ideal VLP candidates, moving from hypothesis to preclinical proof of concept in months. The Company was founded in 2011 and has headquarters in Albuquerque, NM, USA.</p>

<h3>About Sandia National Laboratories</h3>
