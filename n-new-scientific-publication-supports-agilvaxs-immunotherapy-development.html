<p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.--(<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/" target="_blank">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--<a href="http://www.agilvax.com">Agilvax, Inc</a>. announced a significant milestone for its immunotherapy, AX09, for the treatment of <a target="_blank" href="https://tnbcfoundation.org/">triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)</a>. The preclinical results are being published in an article in the journal OncoImmunology, entitled <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2162402X.2017.1408746">“A Virus-Like-Particle immunotherapy targeting Epitope-Specific anti-xCT expressed on cancer stem cell inhibits the progression of metastatic cancer <i>in vivo</i>.”</a> Agilvax is a biotechnology company that develops targeted cancer immunotherapies and vaccines using its proprietary virus-like particle (VLP) discovery and development technology.

<blockquote><p id="pull-quote">“A Virus-Like-Particle immunotherapy targeting Epitope-Specific anti-xCT expressed on cancer stem cell inhibits the progression of metastatic cancer in vivo.”</p></blockquote>

<p> The preclinical results show that AX09 is able to significantly reduce  both tumor growth and the development of pulmonary metastases, as a  result of a robust and specific antibody response against xCT.  Additionally, IgG isolated from AX09 treated mice bound to cancer stem  cells, inhibited xCT function, and decreased cell growth <i>in vitro.</i>  Collectively this data demonstrates the promise of AX09 as a potential  therapy for TNBC. AX09 is currently being tested in combination with  chemotherapy agents and checkpoint inhibitors to improve antitumor  effects. </p>
<p> “AX09 represents a highly promising new therapy for TNBC,” commented  Federica Pericle, Ph.D., MBA, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We  are proud to receive scientific interest in Agilvax, and AX09, as  demonstrated by this publication in a high impact peer reviewed journal.  We are focusing efforts and resources to complete IND enabling studies  and ultimately advancing AX09 through the clinic.” </p>
<p> TNBC is a histological subtype of breast cancer that is aggressive, with  an overall poor prognosis due to a lack of effective treatment options.  Chemotherapy remains the primary treatment for TNBC across the different  settings: neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic. </p>
<p> AX09 is a VLP that displays a portion of the extracellular domain of the  cystine-glutamate antiporter system protein xCT (SLC7A11), which has  been found to be overexpressed in cancer stem cells. TNBC is enriched in  cancer stem cells, which contributes to the aggressive nature of TNBC.  Cancer stem cells have unique biological properties that represent a key  cellular reservoir for relapse, metastatic progression and therapeutic  resistance. Thus, the development of therapies that eliminate cancer  stem cells is paramount to creating a durable response. </p>
<h3>About Agilvax</h3>
<p> Agilvax  discovers and develops targeted cancer immunotherapies and vaccines with  its proprietary virus-like particle (VLP) platform technology. Agilvax’s  lead product, AX09, is being developed as an immunotherapy for  triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) by targeting cancer stem cells.  TNBC has a high frequency of cancer stem cells, which play a critical  role in the high rates of recurrence and poor outcomes in TNBC as  compared with other forms of breast cancer. The company’s pipeline and  drug discovery platform are based on VLPs derived from RNA bacteriophage  that have been engineered to display antigens in an ordered geometric  pattern, which can be utilized to stimulate robust and specific immune  responses to both foreign pathogens and self-antigens. The Company was  founded in 2011 and has headquarters in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and  offices in El Paso, Texas. </p>
