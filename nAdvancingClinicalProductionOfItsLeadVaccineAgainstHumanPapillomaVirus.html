                    <p class="author">Albuquerque, NM</p>
                    <p class="date">February 03, 2015</p>
<p>Albuquerque, NM (February 03, 2015) - Agilvax, Inc. announced an agreement with the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to expedite the clinical development of Agilvax’s virus-like-particle (VLP) vaccine targeting human papillomavirus (HPV).</p>
<p>Agilvax has developed a second-generation HPV vaccine (AX03), which is a recombinant VLP that has been engineered to display a peptide derived from the minor capsid protein, L2, of HPV. Agilvax has demonstrated that in vivo immunization with VLPs displaying the HPV minor capsid protein, L2, produces broadly neutralizing antibodies.</p>
<p>AX03 possesses several advantages over currently licensed HPV vaccines: broader coverage against multiple HPV genotypes, lower production costs, and does not require cold chain storage, which is instrumental for increasing access in developing nations.</p>
<p>Federica Pericle, President & CEO of Agilvax, stated, “The agreement with DMID is crucial to the success of Agilvax; it allows the company to expedite the progression of the vaccine through the clinical development process. The agreement with DMID is also a validation of our product, platform technology, and commitment to serving unmet medical needs.”</p>
<h3>ABOUT THE NIH/NIAID/DMID</h3>
<p>The NIH (www.nih.com) includes 27 Institutes and Centers is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services. It is the primary federal agency for conducting and supporting basic, clinical and translational medical research, and it investigates the causes, treatments, and cures for both common and rare diseases.</p>
<p>NIAID (www.niad.nih.gov) conducts and supports basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases. For more than 60 years, NIAID research has led to new therapies, vaccines, diagnostic tests, and other technologies that have improved the health of millions of people in the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>DMID supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all human infectious agents except HIV. DMID provides funding opportunities and a comprehensive set of resources for researchers that support basic research, preclinical development, and clinical evaluation.</p>
<h3>ABOUT AGILVAX</h3>
<p>Agilvax (www.agilvax.com) develops vaccines targeting infectious diseases (HPV, RSV, Malaria, and Dengue) and immunotherapies to combat cancer utilizing its proprietary virus-like particle (VLP) platform technology. The company has a pipeline and platform that is based on VLPs derived from RNA bacteriophage that have been engineered to incorporate novel vaccine components. The platform allows the company to rapidly identify ideal VLP candidates, moving from hypothesis to preclinical proof of concept in as short as 4 to 6 months. The Company was founded in 2011 and has headquarters in Albuquerque, NM, USA.</p>
